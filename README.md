The application is fun copy of the show "OTYDO", where two teams have a scale of lives, which decreases by exactly as much as they made a mistake in guessing the secret number which is given by the guest. The clue is the guest's answers to the teams' question about him

All rights to the show belong to the 'Minsk cats', and the authors of the show - Gorokh, Zayac, Gauss and Shevelev
